FEEDBACK AMPLIFIER

INTRODUCTION:

Usually, amplifier circuits are used in signal-processing systems to provide good voltage gain .Therefore , amplifier circuits are known as voltage amplifiers .An example of the audio amplifier .When we will provide the small signal in the milivolt to the input section(Microphone) then the signal goes to the preamplifier ciruit which amplifies the input voltage .After the pre amplifier section amplified signal goes to the Driver circuit (it is an specialized integrated cicuit that controls high-power  switches in switch-mode power coneerters).After the process of Driver circuit signal goes to the Power stage amplification ciruit which amplifies the signal and provide the clean and clear audio signal between pre amplifier and power stage a feedback circuits are connected which is check the input signal and output siganl are same or not.
                
 
FEEDBACK AMPLIFIER

A feedback amplifier is an electronics circuit in which the output  signal is tested and respond back to the input to generate an error signal,which drives the amplifiers.There are two types of feedback amplifier.
•	Negative feedback amplifier
•	Positive feedback amplifier
Negative feedback amplifier 
 The negative feedback amplifier is an feedback if the output signal is opposite in value or phase to input phase signal
               
 
The basic block diagram of an inverting feedback  amplifier. Input signal is x and output signal is y let's take z is a the error signal .The gain aroud the loop is negative and it is equal to   where A and B are positive real constant .As loop gain is negative, the feedback is said to negative.                                
This amplifier has an inverting gain,and the feedback signal must be added to the input signal to determine error signal . The output of feedback is   In the inveritng amplifier, the error signal is   .If x is positive and y is negative, so that the error signal will be   
The Overall gain will be   
Hence the ammount of feedback for inverting amplifier is the same as for the noninverting amplifier.
Positive Feedback Amplifier :
                                                    The feedback applied to the input increases the input signal that can be a voltage siganl. In Positive feedback amplifier the amplitude of the input signal is just same as the output signal. It is also known as a direct amplifier .But these kinds of amplifier’s are not better at amplification but can be used in the various types of oscillators.
Application of feedback Amplifier : 

1.	It can be preferred in the regulated power supply
2.	Inverting Amplifiers
3.	Summing Amplifiers
4.	Differentiator 
5.	Integrator
6.	Voltage Follower.
